Welcome to my blog! I'm John, a finance student at Purdue University with a passion for markets, data, and building things.

## What to Expect

This blog is where I'll share thoughts on a variety of topics:

- **Markets & Finance** — Analysis, observations, and lessons from my experience running Father Flips and working in employee benefits
- **Technology** — Web development, data tools, and how tech intersects with finance
- **Career & College** — Reflections on co-founding a consulting club, internships, and navigating the transition from student to professional

## Why a Blog?

Writing helps me think more clearly. I've found that the process of articulating an idea — whether it's a market thesis or a technical concept — sharpens my understanding of it. This blog is as much for me as it is for you.

Thanks for stopping by. If you'd like to connect, head over to the [contact page](/contact).
